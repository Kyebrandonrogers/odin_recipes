            <h3>How to make it</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Prepare the potatoes: </h4>
                    <p>Peel, rinse, and thinly slice the potatoes. Pat the potatoes with a paper towel to dry them and season them with salt.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Add the sliced potatoes to hot olive oil:</h4>
                    <p>making sure the potatoes are fully covered with oil. (Don't worry, you can reuse the oil a few times, so it won't go to waste.) Cook over a medium heat for 20 minutes, being careful not to let them brown too much.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Prepare the eggs:</h4>
                    <p>beat the room-temperature eggs in a bowl until well mixed, and then season with salt</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Thinly slice the onions:</h4>
                    <p>Thinly slice the onions. This will give the tortilla the right texture and help the onions cook more quickly and evenly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Remove the potatoes:</h4>
                    <p>After cooking for about 20 minutes, remove the potatoes from the hot oil using a skimmer or spider. Drain them using a colander and let them cool for roughly 5 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Using a separate pan:</h4>
                    <p>Caramelize the onions using a little olive oil, cook them for around 15-20 minutes over medium heat. Then add them to the egg mixture and gently stir them in.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Add the potatoes:</h4>
                    <p>add the potatoes into the egg/onion mixture, stirring gently to stop them from scrambling the egg. Then let the mixture sit for 15 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Pour the batter into the frying pan:</h4>
                    <p>Gently pour the tortilla batter into a frying pan over medium-low heat. You don't want the pan to be too hot. Gently cook the tortilla for about 6-8 minutes on the first side. You can run a spatula occasionally along the sides to make sure it's not sticking. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Flip the tortilla: </h4>
                    <p>Flip the tortilla and let it cook for 6 to 8 minutes, you may leave it longer if you prefer a more cooked through tortilla.</p>
