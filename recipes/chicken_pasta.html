            <h3>How to make it</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Boil the spaghetti: </h4>
                    <p>Cook the Fettuccine al dente according to package instructions</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Cook the chicken:</h4>
                    <p>Season the chicken, then pan-fry in oil and butter, for 6 minutes a side, or until an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for a few minutes, then cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. Tent with foil, while you prepare the sauce.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Make the alfredo sauce:</h4>
                    <p>Using the same pan you used to cook the chicken, the cream, butter, and seasonings are incorporated and simmered on medium-low heat until thickened, then the Parmesan is added in until melted and smooth.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Assemble:</h4>
                    <p>Drain the pasta, reserving some of the liquid to loosen the sauce (only if necessary.) Toss immediately with the Alfredo sauce. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of cooked chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</p>
