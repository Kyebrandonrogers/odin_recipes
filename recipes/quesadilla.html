        <p>A quesadilla is a Mexican dish that dates back to the 16th century. Traditional quesadillas were made with a corn tortilla that was warmed on a griddle, filled with cheese and various other fillings (meat, vegetables), and then folded over to be eaten by hand.<br>
            The addition of toppings like guacamole, salsa, and sour cream seems to have come along later. And, as Americans have adopted quesadillas, they've put their own spin on them, adding untraditional fillings such as scrambled eggs to make breakfast quesadillas and often swapping out flour tortillas for the corn tortillas.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Large flour tortillas</li>
                <li>Grated cheese such as mild or sharp cheddar, or Monterey Jack</li>
                <li>Olive oil or butter</li>
                <li><strong>You may add any extra ingredients that you would like inside</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to make it</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Heat the tortillas until air pockets form:</h4>
                    <p>Heat a large skillet (cast iron works great) on medium high heat. Add a small amount of oil (about 1/2 teaspoon) and spread it around the bottom of the pan with a spatula (you could use butter as well).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Add the cheese and other ingredients:</h4>
                    <p>When pockets of air begin to form, take a handful of grated cheese, sprinkle over the top of the tortilla, making sure that the cheese does not land on the pan itself.<br>
                        Add whatever additional ingredients you choose - green onion, sliced mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, etc. If you would like your quesadilla to be a chicken quesadilla, add some diced cooked chicken.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Lower the heat and cover pan:</h4>
                    <p>Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. The pan should be hot enough by now to have plenty of residual heat to melt the cheese and brown the tortilla. If the quesadilla begins to smoke too much, remove from the heat.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Fold the tortilla over:</h4>
                    <p>When the cheese is sufficiently melted, use a spatula to lift up one side of the quesadilla and flip over the other side, as if you were making an omelette.<br>
                        The tortilla should by now be browned slightly. If it is not browned, turn the heat up to high and flip the quesadilla over every 10 seconds or so until it gets browned.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Remove quesadilla from pan and cut into wedges:</h4>
                    <p>To make the lettuce to accompany the quesadilla, thinly slice some iceberg lettuce. Sprinkle some cider vinegar on it and some salt.</p>
                </li>
